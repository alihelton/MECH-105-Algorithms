**Mechanical 105 Simpson's 1/3 Rule Algorithm**

This script creates a function used to integrate experimental data using Simpson's 1/3 rule. This function checks if there odd number intervals, and whether to use the trapezoidal rule instead. 

This script also includes error checks that the inputs are the same length, error check that the x input is equally spaced, and warn the user if the trapezoidal rule has to be used on the last interval.
