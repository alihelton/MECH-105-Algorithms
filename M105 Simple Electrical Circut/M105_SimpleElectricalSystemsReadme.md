**Mechanical 105 Simple Electrical Circuit Script**

This script is used to solve a simple electrical circuit with time, initial change, resistance, inductance, and capacitance. 

For this script I use plot functionality as well as subplots to evaluate the change in the circuit when the capacitor is increased.
