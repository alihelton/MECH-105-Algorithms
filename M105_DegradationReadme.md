**Mechanical 105 Degradation of Aqueous Bromide Script**

This script evaluates the photo-degradation of Aqueous Bromide for an particular setup with concentration (parts per million) and t (time).

For this script I use plot and function features in Matlab to display and evaluate the  measured experimental data.
